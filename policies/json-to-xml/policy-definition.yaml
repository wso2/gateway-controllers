description: |
  This policy provides the capability to transform a request/response with a JSON payload to a request/response with an XML payload. This is only applicable to the request flow and response flow mediation sequences.
  This policy assumes that the request/response payload is JSON. Attempting to use it on a request/response with a non-JSON payload will result in premature termination of the mediation flow.
  For the same reason, this policy cannot be attached multiple times to a resource since once it is used, the payload will be an XML value.

        Enables JSON to XML transformation for incoming request payloads (client to upstream).
        When set to true, JSON request bodies will be converted to XML format before forwarding to upstream services.
        When set to false, request bodies will be passed through unchanged.
    onResponseFlow:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: |
        Enables JSON to XML transformation for outgoing response payloads (upstream to client).
        When set to true, JSON response bodies will be converted to XML format before returning to clients.
