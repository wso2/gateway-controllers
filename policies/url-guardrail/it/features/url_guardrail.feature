@url-guardrail
Feature: Url guardrail policy
  As an API developer
  I want the url-guardrail policy to behave as documented
  So that a change to it is caught before it reaches a release

  Background:
    Given the gateway services are running
    And I authenticate using basic auth as "admin"

  # The response must match the expected error response recorded from the policy before a
  # change (resources/expected-error-responses), so a change a client could observe fails.
  Scenario: url-guardrail rejects a request containing an unreachable URL
    Given I generate a unique value from "compat-ug-bad" and store it as "apiName"
    And I generate a unique API version from "compat-ug-bad" and store it as "apiVersion"
    And I generate a unique API context from "/compat-ug-bad" and store it as "apiContext"
    When I create API from "resources/templates/rest-api.yaml" with values:
      | apiVersion             | ${CTX:gatewaySpecVersion}        |
      | name                   | ${CTX:apiName}                   |
      | spec.displayName       | ${CTX:apiName}                   |
      | spec.version           | ${CTX:apiVersion}                |
      | spec.context           | ${CTX:apiContext}/$version       |
      | spec.upstream.main.url | http://testbench:3000            |
      | spec.operations        | [{"method":"GET","path":"/get"},{"method":"POST","path":"/validate","policies":[{"name":"url-guardrail","version":"v1","params":{"request":{"enabled":true,"jsonPath":"","timeout":5000}}}]}] |
    Then the resource creation response should indicate successful deployment
    And I send a "GET" request to "${CTX:apiContext}/${CTX:apiVersion}/get" until status 200

    When I send a "POST" request to "${CTX:apiContext}/${CTX:apiVersion}/validate" with body:
      """
      Check this URL: http://nonexistent-host-12345.invalid/test
      """
    Then the response status code should be 422
    And the response should match the expected error response "url-guardrail-request-invalid-url"
