  MCP ACL List policy controls access to tools, resources, and prompts using
  mode and exceptions. It filters list responses based on the configured mode
  and enforces the same allow/deny rules on request paths. This policy does not
  rewrite capability fields (tools, resources, or prompts) or modify list entry contents.

  - Missing capability config: Allow all capabilities of that type
  - mode: allow, exceptions: [..] => allow all except listed exceptions
  - mode: deny, exceptions: [..] => deny all except listed exceptions
