@prompt-decorator
Feature: Prompt decorator policy
  As an API developer
  I want the prompt-decorator policy to behave as documented
  So that a change to it is caught before it reaches a release

  Background:
    Given the gateway services are running
    And I authenticate using basic auth as "admin"

  # The response must match the expected error response recorded from the policy before a
  # change (resources/expected-error-responses), so a change a client could observe fails.
  Scenario: prompt-decorator rejects an empty request body
    Given I generate a unique value from "compat-pd-empty" and store it as "apiName"
    And I generate a unique API version from "compat-pd-empty" and store it as "apiVersion"
    And I generate a unique API context from "/compat-pd-empty" and store it as "apiContext"
    When I create API from "resources/templates/rest-api.yaml" with values:
      | apiVersion             | ${CTX:gatewaySpecVersion} |
      | name                   | ${CTX:apiName} |
      | spec.displayName       | ${CTX:apiName} |
      | spec.version           | ${CTX:apiVersion} |
      | spec.context           | ${CTX:apiContext}/$version |
      | spec.upstream.main.url | http://testbench:3002 |
      | spec.operations        | [{"method":"POST","path":"/chat","policies":[{"name":"prompt-decorator","version":"v1","params":{"promptDecoratorConfig":{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"Test"}]},"jsonPath":"$.messages","append":false}}]},{"method":"GET","path":"/health"}] |
    Then the resource creation response should indicate successful deployment
    And I send a "GET" request to "${CTX:apiContext}/${CTX:apiVersion}/health" until status 200

    When I send a "POST" request to "${CTX:apiContext}/${CTX:apiVersion}/chat" with body:
      """
      """
    Then the response status code should be 500
    And the response should match the expected error response "prompt-decorator-empty-body"
