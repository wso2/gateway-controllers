# Log Message

## Overview

The Log Message policy provides the capability to log the payload and headers of request/response messages.
This policy operates on both the request flow (logging client requests) and the response flow (logging responses from upstream services before returning to clients).
It is designed for observability and debugging purposes without modifying the actual request/response data.

The policy also supports streaming (SSE) payloads, logging each chunk independently as it arrives for real-time observability into streaming LLM responses.

## Features

- **Configurable Logging**: Control logging of payloads and headers independently
- **Header Filtering**: Exclude sensitive headers from logging using a comma-separated list
- **Security**: Authorization headers are automatically masked with "***"
- **Request ID Tracking**: Tracks request IDs for correlation across request/response flows
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted log output using Go's `slog` package at INFO level for easy parsing and analysis
- **Flow Identification**: Logs are tagged with mediation flow (REQUEST/RESPONSE)
- **Non-intrusive**: Does not modify request/response data, only logs for observability
- **Case-insensitive Header Handling**: Header exclusion works regardless of header name casing
- **Streaming Support**: Logs streaming (SSE) request and response chunks independently as they arrive, providing real-time visibility without buffering or latency overhead

## Configuration

Log Message policy uses a single-level configuration where all parameters are configured in the API definition YAML.

### User Parameters (API Definition)

These parameters are configured per-API/route by the API developer:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `request` | object | No* | - | Configuration for request logging. |
| `request.payload` | boolean | No | `false` | Enables logging of request payloads. When set to `true`, the request bodies will be logged. |
| `request.headers` | boolean | No | `false` | Enables logging of request headers. When set to `true`, the request headers will be logged. |
| `request.excludeHeaders` | array | No | `[]` | An array of header names to exclude from request logging when `request.headers` is enabled. Example: `["Authorization", "X-API-Key"]` will exclude these headers from being logged. Header names are case-insensitive. |
| `response` | object | No* | - | Configuration for response logging. |
| `response.payload` | boolean | No | `false` | Enables logging of response payloads. When set to `true`, the response bodies will be logged. |
| `response.headers` | boolean | No | `false` | Enables logging of response headers. When set to `true`, the response headers will be logged. |
| `response.excludeHeaders` | array | No | `[]` | An array of header names to exclude from response logging when `response.headers` is enabled. Example: `["Set-Cookie", "X-Internal-Token"]` will exclude these headers from being logged. Header names are case-insensitive. |

*At least one of `request` or `response` must be provided.

**Note:**

Inside the `gateway/build.yaml`, ensure the policy module is added under `policies:`:

```yaml
- name: log-message
  gomodule: github.com/wso2/gateway-controllers/policies/log-message@v1
```

## Reference Scenarios

### Example 1: Default Behavior (No Logging)

At least one of `request` or `response` must be supplied — the policy is rejected if `params` is
omitted entirely. Within whichever block you supply, every individual field defaults to `false`, so
an empty `request: {}` attaches the policy without logging anything:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.api-platform.wso2.com/v1
kind: RestApi
metadata:
  name: no-logging-api-v1.0
spec:
  displayName: No Logging API
  version: v1.0
  context: /no-logging/$version
  upstream:
    main:
      url: http://backend-service:8080
  policies:
    - name: log-message
      version: v1
      params:
        request: {}   # payload and headers both default to false
  operations:
    - method: GET
      path: /data
    - method: POST
      path: /submit
```

### Example 2: Basic Log Message Configuration

Log both payloads and headers for all requests and responses:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.api-platform.wso2.com/v1
kind: RestApi
metadata:
  name: user-api-v1.0
spec:
  displayName: User API with Logging
  version: v1.0
  context: /users/$version
  upstream:
    main:
      url: http://user-service:8080
  policies:
    - name: log-message
      version: v1
      params:
        request:
          payload: true
          headers: true
        response:
          payload: true
          headers: true
  operations:
    - method: GET
      path: /profile
    - method: POST
      path: /profile
    - method: PUT
      path: /settings
```

### Example 3: Request-Only Logging

Log only request payloads and headers, skip response logging:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.api-platform.wso2.com/v1
kind: RestApi
metadata:
  name: request-only-api-v1.0
spec:
  displayName: Request Only API
  version: v1.0
  context: /request-only/$version
  upstream:
    main:
      url: http://backend-service:8080
  policies:
    - name: log-message
      version: v1
      params:
        request:
          payload: true
          headers: true
  operations:
    - method: POST
      path: /sensitive-data
```

### Example 4: Response-Only Logging

Log only response payloads and headers, skip request logging:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.api-platform.wso2.com/v1
kind: RestApi
metadata:
  name: response-only-api-v1.0
spec:
  displayName: Response Only API
  version: v1.0
  context: /response-only/$version
  upstream:
    main:
      url: http://backend-service:8080
  policies:
    - name: log-message
      version: v1
      params:
        response:
          payload: true
          headers: true
  operations:
    - method: GET
      path: /public-data
```

### Example 5: Headers with Different Exclusions

Log headers but exclude different sensitive headers for requests vs responses:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.api-platform.wso2.com/v1
kind: RestApi
metadata:
  name: payment-api-v1.0
spec:
  displayName: Payment API
  version: v1.0
  context: /payments/$version
  upstream:
    main:
      url: http://payment-service:8080
  policies:
    - name: log-message
      version: v1
      params:
        request:
          payload: true
          headers: true
          excludeHeaders:
            - Authorization
            - X-API-Key
            - X-Payment-Token
        response:
          payload: true
          headers: true
          excludeHeaders:
            - Set-Cookie
            - X-Internal-Token
  operations:
    - method: GET
      path: /transactions
    - method: POST
      path: /charge
```

### Example 6: Selective Logging

Log only request payloads and response headers:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.api-platform.wso2.com/v1
kind: RestApi
metadata:
  name: selective-api-v1.0
spec:
  displayName: Selective API
  version: v1.0
  context: /selective/$version
  upstream:
    main:
      url: http://backend-service:8080
  policies:
    - name: log-message
      version: v1
      params:
        request:
          payload: true
        response:
          headers: true
  operations:
    - method: POST
      path: /analyze
```

### Example 7: Operation-Specific Logging

Apply different logging configurations to different operations:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.api-platform.wso2.com/v1
kind: RestApi
metadata:
  name: mixed-api-v1.0
spec:
  displayName: Mixed API
  version: v1.0
  context: /mixed/$version
  upstream:
    main:
      url: http://backend-service:8080
  operations:
    - method: GET
      path: /public-data
      policies:
        - name: log-message
          version: v1
          params:
            request:
              headers: true
              excludeHeaders:
                - Authorization
            response:
              payload: true
    - method: POST
      path: /sensitive-operation
      policies:
        - name: log-message
          version: v1
          params:
            request:
              payload: true
    - method: PUT
      path: /debug-endpoint
      policies:
        - name: log-message
          version: v1
          params:
            request:
              payload: true
              headers: true
              excludeHeaders:
                - Authorization
                - X-Debug-Token
            response:
              payload: true
              headers: true
              excludeHeaders:
                - X-Internal-Key
                - Set-Cookie
```

### Example 8: Streaming LLM Response Logging

Log streaming SSE response payloads from an LLM provider for real-time observability:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.api-platform.wso2.com/v1
kind: LlmProvider
metadata:
  name: streaming-log-provider
spec:
  displayName: Streaming Log Provider
  version: v1.0
  template: openai
  context: /openai
  upstream:
    url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
    auth:
      type: api-key
      header: Authorization
      value: Bearer <openai-apikey>
  accessControl:
    mode: deny_all
    exceptions:
      - path: /chat/completions
        methods: [POST]
  operationPolicies:
    - name: log-message
      version: v1
      paths:
        - path: /chat/completions
          methods: [POST]
          params:
            request:
              payload: true
            response:
              payload: true
```

When the upstream returns a streaming response (`stream: true`), each SSE chunk is logged independently as it arrives. No buffering or accumulation is performed, providing real-time visibility into the token stream without added latency.

## How it Works

* The log-message policy automatically masks only the `Authorization` header with `"***"` by default (case-insensitive), preventing accidental exposure of bearer tokens and basic auth credentials carried in that header.
* Administrators can configure **header exclusions** separately for requests and responses using `request.excludeHeaders` and `response.excludeHeaders` arrays; excluded headers are completely omitted from log output.
* Sensitive headers other than `Authorization` (for example `X-API-Key`, `Cookie`, or `Set-Cookie`) are not masked automatically and should be explicitly excluded when header logging is enabled.
* The policy supports **request ID correlation** by extracting the `x-request-id` header, using the same ID in both request and response logs, or `<request-id-unavailable>` if absent, enabling end-to-end tracing.
* **Content processing** is non-intrusive: request and response bodies are buffered in memory, headers are filtered for security, and flows are automatically identified and tagged as REQUEST or RESPONSE.
* When content is missing or empty, the policy still creates log entries with placeholders -- omitting payloads or headers fields as needed, and providing fallback values for missing request IDs.

### Streaming (SSE) Processing

When the upstream returns an SSE streaming response, each SSE event arrives as a `data:` line containing a JSON payload, for example:

```
data: {"choices":[{"delta":{"content":"token"}}]}
```

The log-message policy uses a **no-buffering pattern** for streaming:

1. **Immediate Processing**: `NeedsMoreResponseData` always returns `false`. Each chunk is logged independently as soon as it arrives, with no accumulation or delay.
2. **Per-Chunk Logging**: Every streaming chunk (both request and response) is logged as a separate structured JSON log record, including the chunk payload, request ID, HTTP method, and resource path.
3. **No Modification**: The policy never modifies or blocks streaming data. Chunks pass through untouched after being logged.
4. **Bidirectional Streaming**: Both request and response streaming chunks are supported. `NeedsMoreRequestData` and `NeedsMoreResponseData` both return `false`.
5. **Error Handling**: Since this policy is read-only and never intervenes, there are no SSE error events to inject. Logging failures are reported via `slog.Error` without affecting the stream.

This no-buffering approach provides real-time observability into streaming LLM responses without adding latency or memory overhead.

## Limitations

1. **Memory Buffering**: Large payloads require significant memory for buffering during logging
2. **No Partial Logging**: Cannot log only specific parts of payloads (logs entire content)
3. **Binary Content**: Binary payloads may not log readably (will be logged as raw bytes)
4. **Real-time Constraints**: Logging overhead may not be suitable for ultra-low-latency requirements
5. **Log Format**: Output format is fixed JSON structure and cannot be customized


## Notes

**Sensitive Data Protection and Security**

Protect sensitive data by excluding authentication and confidential headers, relying on default masking only for the `Authorization` header, and carefully evaluating the sensitivity of logged payload content. Regularly review the excluded headers list to ensure headers with credentials or personal data are not logged, and apply selective logging per operation. Beyond technical controls, control log access and handling by restricting log visibility to authorized personnel and ensuring secure transmission and storage of logs. Maintain compliance with data privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA by aligning your logging practices accordingly.

**Performance and Resource Management**

Payload buffering, JSON marshaling, and logging introduce additional memory and CPU usage per request. In high-traffic environments, high log volume and large payloads can significantly increase storage and I/O pressure. To mitigate performance impact, avoid large payload logging in high-traffic scenarios, manage log storage proactively, and enforce appropriate log retention policies. Enable detailed logging selectively to minimize performance degradation rather than logging everything by default.

**Operational Best Practices**

Improve traceability by including `x-request-id` headers in client requests to correlate logs across systems and monitor log volume and disk usage continuously. Be aware that logging is disabled by default; ensure the relevant request/response logging parameters are explicitly set to `true`. Verify that sensitive headers are excluded and disable payload logging for large uploads and downloads to avoid both security exposure and performance slowdown. All logging parameters are optional, must be boolean, and default to `false`. Ensure excluded header names are correctly spelled, case-insensitive, and properly comma-separated in your configuration.
