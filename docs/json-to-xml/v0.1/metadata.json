  "description": "This policy provides the capability to transform a request/response with a JSON payload to a request/response with an XML payload. This is only applicable to the request flow and response flow mediation sequences.\nThis policy assumes that the request/response payload is JSON. Attempting to use it on a request/response with a non-JSON payload will result in premature termination of the mediation flow.\nFor the same reason, this policy cannot be attached multiple times to a resource since once it is used, the payload will be an XML value."
