# Analytics Header Filter

## Overview

The Analytics Header Filter policy allows you to control which request and response headers are included in analytics data using allow or deny modes. This policy is intended to prevent sensitive, noisy, or irrelevant headers from being sent to analytics backends while preserving the rest of the request and response context.

The policy is only effective when analytics is enabled at the system level and must be explicitly added to the API’s policy chain.

**Operation modes:**
- **"allow"**: Only the specified headers will be included in analytics (whitelist mode)
- **"deny"**: All headers except the specified ones will be included in analytics (blacklist mode)

Request and response headers can have different operation modes, allowing for flexible filtering strategies.


## Features

* Filters request and response headers from analytics data collection using allow or deny modes
* Case-insensitive header matching
* Supports independent configuration with flexible filtering strategies with whitelist (allow) and blacklist (deny) modes
* Operates transparently without affecting request or response processing
* Helps protect sensitive information from being exposed in analytics systems


## Configuration

Analytics Header Filter requires two levels of configuration.

### System Parameters (From config.toml)

| Parameter                                  | Type     | Default | Description                                                                      |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `analytics.enabled`                          | boolean  | false   | Enables or disables analytics processing.                                        |
| `analytics.allow_payloads`                  | boolean  | false   | Determines whether request and response payloads are included in analytics data. |
| `analytics.enabled_publishers`               | string[] | []      | List of analytics publishers to enable.                                          |
| `analytics.publishers.moesif.application_id` | string   | —       | Application ID used to authenticate with the Moesif analytics service.           |


#### Sample System Configuration

```toml

[analytics]
enabled = true
allow_payloads = false
enabled_publishers = ["moesif"]

[analytics.publishers.moesif]
application_id = "<MOESIF_APPLICATION_ID>"

```

### User Parameters (API Definition)

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `request` | object | No | - | Configuration for filtering request headers in analytics. At least one of `request` or `response` must be provided. |
| `response` | object | No | - | Configuration for filtering response headers in analytics. At least one of `request` or `response` must be provided. |

### Request / Response Configuration

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `mode` | string | Yes | `"deny"` | Operation mode: `"allow"` (whitelist) or `"deny"` (blacklist). Header names are matched case-insensitively. |
| `headers` | array | No | `[]` | List of header names to allow or deny. Each header name must be 1-256 characters. Unique items only. |

**Note**: 
This policy only affects analytics data collection. It does not remove or modify headers sent to upstream services or returned to clients.

Inside the `gateway/build.yaml`, ensure the policy module is added under `policies:`:

```yaml
- name: analytics-header-filter
  gomodule: github.com/wso2/gateway-controllers/policies/analytics-header-filter@v0
```

## Reference Scenarios

### Example 1: Analytics Header Filter policy to a LlmProvider:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.api-platform.wso2.com/v1alpha1
kind: LlmProvider
metadata:
  name: openai-provider
spec:
  displayName: OpenAI Provider
  version: v1.0
  template: openai
  upstream:
    url: https://api.openai.com/v1
    auth:
      type: api-key
      header: Authorization
      value: Bearer <openai-apikey>
  accessControl:
    mode: deny_all
    exceptions:
      - path: /chat/completions
        methods: [POST]
        policies:
          - name: analytics-header-filter
            version: v0
            params:
              request:
                mode: deny
                headers:
                  - "authorization"
                  - "x-api-key"
              response:
                mode: allow
                headers:
                  - "content-type"
      - path: /models
        methods: [GET]
      - path: /models/{modelId}
        methods: [GET]

```


## Notes

* Header name matching is case-insensitive.
* The `mode` field is required and must be either `"allow"` or `"deny"`.
* The `headers` array is optional and defaults to `[]`. When the array is empty, all original headers are included (if allowed explicitly) in analytics for both `"allow"` and `"deny"` modes (safe fallback behavior).
* Request and response headers can use different operation modes independently.
* This policy does not block requests or responses.
* Filtering applies only to analytics collection, not to runtime request handling.
* The policy must be applied per API and does not operate implicitly.
