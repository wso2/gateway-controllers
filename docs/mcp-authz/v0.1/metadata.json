  "description": "MCP Authorization policy validates access to MCP resources (tools, resources, prompts) \nand methods based on JWT claims or OAuth scopes provided by the mcp-auth policy.\n\nThis policy enforces fine-grained authorization by checking that incoming JWT claims \nor scopes satisfy the access requirements for specific MCP attributes. The mcp-auth \npolicy must be applied before this policy to validate and extract claims from the token."
